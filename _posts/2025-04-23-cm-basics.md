The connection manager is a tool built into SQLcl to manage connections (as the name would imply).
We can use ```conmgr``` or ```cm``` if we want to save some typing. 
First let's validate that there are no configured connections.

```sql
SQL> cm list
.
SQL> 
```

Let's create our first connection.  Interestingly, this is not done with ```conmgr```, but with the ```con[nect]``` command with appropriate flags.
It's worth noting that the connection details (name, connect string and redacted password) are displayed, this doesn't happen when simply connecting without saving.  If you don't specify the ```-savepwd``` flag, then you will have to re-enter the password every time you use the connection.

```sql
SQL> conn -save tom -savepwd tom/tom@localhost:1521/orclpdb1
Name: tom
Connect String: localhost:1521/orclpdb1
User: tom
Password: ******
Connected.
SQL> 
```

The ```cm list``` subcommand now shows our newly added connection.
```sql
SQL> cm list
.
└── tom
SQL> 
```


If we want to show details of the connection we use ```cm show``` subcommand:
```sql
SQL> cm show tom
Name: tom
Connect String: localhost:1521/orclpdb1
User: tom
Password: ******
SQL> 
```

```sql
SQL> cm test tom
Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
Connection Test Successful
SQL> 
```

Now within SQLcl if we want to connect with that defined connection we can do so with the ```-name``` flag  for the ```connect``` command.
```sql
SQL> conn -name tom
Connected.
```

Even better, you can use the ```-name``` flag when launching SQLcl to connect directly using this saved connection.
```sql
➜  ~ sql -name tom

```

How do we modify details about the connection?  Let's update the password.
```sql
SQL> alter user tom identified by tommy;

User TOM altered.
```

To update the saved connection, we use the ```-save``` and ```-savepwd``` flags for the ```conn``` command, but use the ```-replace``` command to overwrite the connection with the new details.
```sql
SQL> conn -save tom -replace -savepwd tom/tommy@localhost:1521/orclpdb1
Name: tom
Connect String: localhost:1521/orclpdb1
User: tom
Password: ******
Connected.
SQL> cm list
.
├── tom
└── tom
```
Unfortunately there is currently a bug where the -replace flag doesn't work, so we end up with two connections.
Fortunately, a new command allows us to delete connections, so to finish off let's delete them (both).

```sql
SQL> cm delete -conn tom
Connection tom has been deleted
SQL> cm list
.
└── tom
SQL> cm delete -conn tom
Connection tom has been deleted
SQL> cm list
.
```
